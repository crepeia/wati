Introduction

This repository hosts the Live without tobacco ("Viva sem Tabaco") project, the first open-source web-assisted intervention for smoking cessation. The intervention content is based on the widely accepted guideline *Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence* (U.S Departament of Health and Human Services).
